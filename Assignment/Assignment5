#Assignment-1


1. Suppose we have two queues, P and Q, and one stack S. We are only allowed to dequeue
from P and allowed to enqueue into the Q. We can do push and pop from the stack. In this
program you will be given a permutation of n numbers and asked to check if it is a stack
permutation or not.
[Stack permutation: A stack permutation is a ordering of numbers from 1 to n that can
be obtained from the initial ordering 1, 2, ... n by a sequence of stack operations.]


2. Write a program to categorize the words having same length with their frequency of
occurring in a given text. The list should display the frequency of each word
corresponding to a specific length taken as an input.


3. Suppose 7 persons are recruited in a company to do their specific tasks. Each task
requires a fixed amount of time to complete and all those tasks are needed to be
done in a single platform that can be shared by each employee. But as per the
regulations of the company every employee should report to his/her immediate boss
after doing the work every 2 units of time only. The following table shows the name
of the employee, their assigned task number and total time required to complete
their tasks. Find the order of the employees with different time stamps to
accomplish the assigned tasks. You have to show starting time, ending time and the
different time instants at which the employees shared that common platform. Take
name of the employee as input who will start work first from 0th time instant.

Employee Name Task Number Time to complete
A 2 10
B 5 11
C 7 5
D 1 8
E 3 19
F 6 23
G 4 11
