##Assignment 4

1. Write a method duplicateStack that returns a new stack
containing the same elements and in the same order as the
stack specified in the parameter. The method should create a
new stack and fill it with the same data elements as the given
stack. (you do not need to duplicate the contents of the
elements.). Before the method finishes, it must restore the
contents of the original stack to its original state (same contents
in the same order).

2. a) Write a program to convert an infix expression of integers
into its equivalent postfix and prefix notation using stack.
b) Write a program to evaluate a postfix expression.
(Note: integers can be of more than one digit)


3. Write a program in C that will check a file containing html
code. The html code contains the different tags and every tag
starts and ends in proper order like parenthesis in an
expression. You have to check whether the tags are written
properly or not from the given file.
